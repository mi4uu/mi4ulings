[REF](./PLAN-01.md#v02) - Move implementation summary from every doc in docs/dev into separate file... (CHANGE [] -> [x])

- SUMMARY:
    - Created `_worklog.md` files and moved implementation history into them.

- DESCRIPTION:
    - Created `PLAN-01_worklog.md`, `CONFIG_worklog.md`, and `DOCLING_worklog.md`.
    - Extracted implementation summaries and plan completion details from `PLAN-01.md`, `CONFIG.md`, and `DOCLING.md`.
    - Populated the `_worklog.md` files with initial entries reflecting the completion of v0.1 tasks according to the specified format.
    - Removed the `IMPLEMENTATION SUMMARY` section from `PLAN-01.md`.
    - Removed the `PLAN` sections from `CONFIG.md` and `DOCLING.md`.
